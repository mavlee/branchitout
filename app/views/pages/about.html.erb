    <p>From Chris, "I'm a jack-of-all trades engineer who strives to get the job done. My experience from co-op has ranged from doing computer vision on flying robots to working on a social network site with millions of monthly active users. I've decided to work in startups because of the culture and the chance to be responsible for "making a dent in the world"."</p>
